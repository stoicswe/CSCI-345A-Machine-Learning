Neural Network Analysis
-----------------------

When adding more neurons to the network while classifying on a
dataset, a neural network with more hidden layers will have a
lower loss rate, indicating that it has more "power." This
further indicates that a neural network with more hidden neurons
will be able to classify more data in a dataset.

For reference, the dataset used was the titanic dataset...particularily
the gender and class columns. This data was analyzed for classification
of gender by the passenger class.
